# libft
improved libft with more functions than the one from the 42 libft project.
*Yes it's norm conform*
Libft Bonus is kinda useless so it's not in here but either way this lib has better functions for that

## Includes
- [ ] normal libft functions (some might have been improved)
- [ ] get_next_line
- [ ] ft_printf
- [ ] Dynamic Pointer Garbage Collector
- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues

## How to use?
### Compiling
- *clone* this repo and add it to your project OR onlz clone it when you comopile it with your Makefile
- when compiling also compile libft and add the libft.a to the compiler args
### Code
- just include the libft.h file


## Why are some functions written so complex for no reason?
That's simple. When i first started i wasn't able to write compact code and now im too lazy to change the more complex functions
